HOW TO CONVERT LOW QUALITY .ACMs MANUALLY
=========================================


1. Extract the .acm to .wav

acmtools\acm2wav.exe [file]


2. Convert sampling rate via ssrc

ssrc-1.30\ssrc_hp.exe --rate 44100 --bits 16 [input file] [output file]


3. (Re)compress to .acm in the best quality possible 

acmtools\snd2acm.exe [input .wav] [output .acm] -q0



Any degradation in quality through conversion *should* be tolerable. 

If you have access to the source .wavs used, it is obviously a much better option to use those instead. They should be saved as 16bit 44.1kHz PCM (you can compress them directly via Step 3).
